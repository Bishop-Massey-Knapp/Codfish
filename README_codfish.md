Codfish Hollow Barnstormers – Event Center Website
==================================================

Overview
--------
This project is a fully responsive, multi-page website for Codfish Hollow Barnstormers, a real-life music and event venue located in Maquoketa, Iowa. The site was built to meet the Coding Temple HTML & CSS module requirements while also serving as a portfolio-ready example of clean, semantic code and polished design. It showcases upcoming concerts, food menu offerings, location details, and a contact form for booking and inquiries.

Purpose
-------
This project was created to:
- Fulfill the HTML & CSS Event Center Website module requirements.
- Demonstrate skills in semantic HTML5, organized CSS3, and responsive design principles.
- Apply real-world design decisions for a live music venue.
- Include interactive and accessible components for a better user experience.
- Provide a professional example of a complete, multi-page front-end project.

Tech Stack
----------

- CSS3 for styling (flexbox, grid, media queries)
- Google Fonts: DM Sans (body), Barlow Condensed (headings), Pirata One (decorative)
